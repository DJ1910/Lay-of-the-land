    <h1>Lay of the land</h1>
    <p>Lay of the land is a phrase that figuratively or metaphorically means the current state of affairs, how something is organized. Literally, the lay of the land is the arrangement of features upon the land. One usually assesses the lay of the land in preparation for action. The idiom lay of the land is first recorded in 1819. A related idiom is the British phrase how the land lies, a usage that turns up in about 1700. According to Google Ngram Viewer, the use of the term lay of the land peaked in the early 1900s. Lay of the land is a North American phrase.

      <h2>What's the good word, big bird?</h2>
      <p class="authdate">by John <span class="slash">//</span> November 13, 2006 <span class="slash">//</span> 2:34 am</p>
      <p>Three teams of two players each competed over guessing the key word with a list of related clues. Play began with an introductory clue. For example, a set might begin with "This can either be a friend to man or an enemy." Clues would then be read while the timer clicked down. Clues for this sample set might be: WILD, RED, FLASH, GUN, ANTS, SIDE, TRUCK, HYDRANT, and finally FIGHTER (a maximum of ten clues would be revealed). The good word, of course, is FIRE. When a team rang in to answer, they would write their response down. If they were correct, they earned one point for every clue that was revealed. If they were incorrect, the team scored 11 points.</p>
      <p>If two or more teams rang in on the same clue, the host would then mention the order the teams signaled; the first team, if correct, would score one point for each revealed clue; the second team, if right, would get that same number plus one point, and if the third team rang in and was right, they would score that same number plus two points. If only two teams rang in and were both right, the third team would have to wait for two more clues to be revealed before they could ring in (they could answer verbally at that point). Whoever had the fewest points when time ran out won the game and would play a bonus game similar to regular play.</p>

      <h2>Let's test some style elements</h2>
      <p class="authdate">by Michael <span class="slash">//</span> November 12, 2006 <span class="slash">//</span> 6:55 pm</p>
      <p><img src="butterfly.jpg" alt="Butterfly" class="float_left" />To the left you will see an image styled with the "float_left" class. It applies the correct margins as well. If you haven't already guessed it, there is a "float_right" class as well. Next, we can show off what a link looks like: <a href="https://www.google.com/">Click here</a>. That was fun. Why don't you check out this <b>bold text</b>? You can use the 'strong' or 'b' tag; they are both styled exactly the same. This <i>italicized text</i> looks swell, don't you think?</p>
      <p>This is an example of <ins>inserted text</ins> with a <del>word</del> on which the delete tag has been used! </p>
      <p>We can also write equations: X<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup> = 1 or something like H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>
      <p>Blockquotes are useful for displaying a quote that runs more than two lines in a normal paragraph. Here is an example of what a blockquote looks like in this template:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Loyalty is a two-way street.If I'm asking for it from you then you're getting it from me. - Harvey Specter</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here are some sample lists:</p>
      <ul class="arrow">
        <li>Internet Explorer 6</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer 7</li>
        <li>Safari 2.0.4</li>
        <li>Firefox 1.5-2.0</li>
        <li>Opera 9.0.2</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Internet Explorer 6</li>

        <li>Safari 2.0.4</li>
        <li>Firefox 1.5-2.0</li>
        <li>Opera 9.0.2</li>
      </ol>

<p>Here is a sample table: </p>
